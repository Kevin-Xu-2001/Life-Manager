Your consent may be obtained verbally at the store level, in writing on our store forms, through written registration or ballot forms, electronically through our Site, during telephone conversations or during a live chat session.

We only collect certain information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register; (2) place an order; (3) shop in our Stores; (4) complete a survey or product review; (5) participate in one of our promotions; (6) sign up for a Loyalty Program; or (7) contact us. The information we collect from you may include your name, age, date of birth, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.

Registration. We encourage you to register when shopping on our Site; however registration is not required. Our registration form requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address and password). You must be 14 years of age or older to register. Registration helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience. The customer contact information you provide will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your questions and, if you have chosen to opt-in, to send you communications about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information, including via email, instant message, SMS text message and direct mail. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration information and password. You are responsible for all use of the Site under your registered account. If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve your shopping experience and to provide you with more relevant content and advertising.

Information We Automatically Collect. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Site, or interact with our emails or advertisements on our Site or other websites. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive. For example, we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data (if activated by you), unique user ID, cell phone model, operating system, and carrier, and Internet Service Provider. We also may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the time you spend using the Site, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other Site usage data. These technologies, such as cookies, allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our Site, recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with information and advertising that is more relevant to them.

If you register with or order from us, we may use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Site and what you buy in order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising.

As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that our company or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through the Services in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

For the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, we or one of our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider may process and store your personal information outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada, and as such, courts in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your personal information.

We may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about Site users with third parties.

We may amend this Privacy Statement at any time. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or disclose your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Site. Any material changes to this Privacy Statement will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our transmittal of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of the notice of changes.
