# Life-Manager-Bookkeeping-System

This is a website running on the server to provide bookkeeping service. You can open an account through the login system. With your account, you can record every expense by typing in the basic information (cost, item name, shop name, date, notes...). Then you can click the "Money Charts" button to see your own cost analysis. You will have bar charts for both daily and monthly costs. You will also have a scatter chart for every day cost in a month.
